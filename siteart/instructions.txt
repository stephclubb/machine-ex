Add Auctiontime (AT) branding:
If the website has more than one page, position the logo ONLY on the page where the AuctionTime listings appear. 

There are two varieties of the AT brand logo in the folder.
1. AuctionTimecom_PoweredBy.png is the regular logo, which can be used on any light background.
2. AuctionTimecom_PoweredBy_REVERSED.png is a white logo to use on darker backgrounds.

Use whichever logo works best for the website you are adding it to.


Here is an example of the image tag with alt text that they would like us to use:
<img src="siteart/AuctionTimecom_PoweredBy.png" alt="Online Bidding Powered By AuctionTime.com" style="width:250px;" />


For example, view these websites where we have already added the AT branding:
